# GranulRef

Tool to transform repository commit history into different granularities and detect refactorings.

## Coarse-grained Refactoring & Ephemeral Refactoring

**Coarse-grained Refactoring (CGR):** A refactoring whose code changes are recorded across multiple commits, rather than confined in a single commit. 

**Ephemeral Refactoring (EPR):** A refactoring whose code changes are recorded within a single commit and where modifications in adjacent commits would disrupt their integrity. 

## Refactoring Detection

Refactoring detection tool used is [RefactoringMiner3.0.4](https://github.com/tsantalis/RefactoringMiner)

## Usage
1. Remove Comment
```shell
python3 remove_comment.py -s <repo_path> -t <output_path_for_comment_removed_repo>
```
2. Detect Refactoring
```shell
python3 command.py -r  -c <path_for_comment_removed_repo> -o <output_dir_for_ref>
```
3. Trace Refactoring 
```shell
python3 trace.py -f <output_dir_for_ref> -r  <output_path_for_comment_removed_repo/.git>
```
4. Collect CGR & EPR for repository
```shell
python3 coarse_fine_ref_extractor.py -p <output_dir_for_ref> -c <output_path_for_comment_removed_repo> -r <repo_name>
```
