# SCRMDetection

Tool used to analyze features of coarse-grained refactorings

## Coarse-grained Refactoring
Refactorings can be detected only in coarse-grained commits rather in fine-grained ones. Coarse-grained commits can be generated by squashing multiple consecutive fine-grained commits.

## Refactoring Detection
Refactoring detection tool used is [RefactoringMiner2.2](https://github.com/tsantalis/RefactoringMiner)

Both refactorings in coarse and fine-gained commits will be detected and compared.

## Coarse-grained Commits Generation
Repository rewrite tool [git-stein](https://github.com/sh5i/git-stein) is used to squash commits to generate coarse-grained commits

## What can it do

### Calculate Frequency
- Coarse-grained refactoirngs occurence frequency
### Analyse Type
- Which types of refactorings tend to be coarse-grained refactorings
### Analyse Reason
- Reasons for the occurence of coarse-grained refactorings can be observed by using results from this tool with code change in fine-grained commits

## Procedure
Procedure is showed below
